# DeepSeek-ASI: Enhanced DeepSeek for Artificial Super Intelligence

This project extends [DeepSeek-V3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) with enhancements aimed at developing Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). It incorporates advanced reasoning, self-evolution, ethical alignment, and collaborative intelligence features.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Self-Reflection and Self-Correction**  
   The model can analyze and improve its reasoning outputs dynamically.

2. **Long-Term Memory**  
   A memory storage system to retain and recall historical interactions for better reasoning.

3. **Advanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning**  
   Step-by-step structured reasoning for enhanced problem-solving.

4. **Ethical Alignment**  
   Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) ensures safety and alignment with human values.

5. **Collaborative Intelligence**  
   Multi-agent framework enabling distributed reasoning and cooperation between AI agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izzuddin-noormy/artificial-superintelligence.git
   cd DeepSeek-V3
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
